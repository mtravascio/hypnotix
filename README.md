# TV Channels and media content

Hypnotix does not provide content or TV channels, it is a player application which streams from IPTV providers.

By default, Hypnotix is configured with one IPTV provider called Free-TV: https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV.

This provider was chosen because it satisfied the following criterias:

- It only includes free, legal, publicly available content
- It groups TV channels by countries
- It doesn't include adult content

Issues relating to TV channels and media content should be addressed directly to the relevant provider.

Note: Feel free to remove Free-TV from Hypnotix if you don't use it, or add any other provider you may have access to or local M3U playlists.
